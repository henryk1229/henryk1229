### Hello,

<!--
**henryk1229/henryk1229** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Henry.

I’m currently working in the political tech space, at <a href="https://www.politicsrewired.com/" target="_blank">politics rewired</a>.

I principally work with Typescript, React, Postgres, GraphQL, Node, and Rust.

Recently I've been exploring frontend development with Svelte.

In my spare time, I like to build <a href="https://github.com/henryk1229/wordsalad">word games</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5BN5Uywy6N8nWwmIB7Jr7A?si=KM2GxzfzTn61g3ncSZMOAg" target="_blank">make music</a>.
